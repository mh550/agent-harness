# Context pack for `Q1-01`

Chosen by the harness from entries.jsonl in a fixed order; each item names its line. The full record is entries.jsonl / progress-archive.md.

## Discoveries for this feature

- Discovery (init, affects run): C1-04's two timed suites (about 15 min each on this box) run outside the suite command, in the session, in the background with a timeout: the full run per session comes on top, so that feature needs a session well over 40 min → entries.jsonl:1
- Discovery (init, affects run): An idle coordinator poll with one lane open and MAX_LANES=1 (the default) makes no F call at all; C1-03's idle-poll check needs MAX_LANES=2 in the stub project's .harness/config.sh so a free slot exists and F unpark, F lanes and answers_hash (inbox.mjs) run each poll → entries.jsonl:1
- Discovery (init, affects run): F unpark mutates the parked file when it unparks: C1-02 may serve a memoized unpark answer only when the stored answer was empty (no mutation); F lanes reads the state dir (verified-/needs- marks), so it is not memoizable on the list alone → entries.jsonl:1

## Lately in the run

- 2026-11-03 10:57 · init · passes: 8 features: Q1 2 (the spec check in start and queue add; the runner's park at dequeue, docs and folded review), C1 6 (C1-01 strace exec table and plan; C1-02 F memo keyed on content; C1-03 F poll, treekey merge, builtins; C1-04 before/after solo suites; C1-05 one full run per session and the Suite runs row; C1-06 review + simplify). Q1 then C1, in series. → entries.jsonl:1

## Current rules

- The suite's length in every prompt: a green marker's `wall` line, and a timeout rule → journal/decisions/2026-10-30-suite-length-in-prompt.md
- A red tree is cached: `red-<key>`, so the next full call on the tree just found red runs nothing → journal/decisions/2026-10-30-red-marker.md
- A mapped path's change runs only its readers: `CHECK_KEY_MAP`, the `part-<key>` sidecar, the partial run, the lint → journal/decisions/2026-10-30-partial-key.md
- The coordinator opens no lane while a lane that exited is not reaped yet → journal/decisions/2026-10-30-opens-wait-for-reap.md
- The lane guard reverts against the lane's merge-base with main, in the index only → journal/decisions/2026-10-30-lane-guard-base.md
- Timing checks bound CPU time; a stopped file's missing names don't void `HARNESS_FAILED=` → journal/decisions/2026-10-30-cpu-time-bound-and-stopped-files.md
- The suite waits on a condition or a barrier, never on the clock; a flake is reproduced with --repeat and fixed at its cause → journal/decisions/2026-10-29-tests-wait-not-sleep.md
- The rerun guard: a red full suite is rerun once; a flake is green, named and counted, never quarantined → journal/decisions/2026-10-29-rerun-guard.md
- Questions wait in `harness needs` until answered: one item per question, moved forward, no push → journal/decisions/2026-10-29-questions-wait.md
- Lanes leftovers: atomic list writes, a record-only main, the finish order, two lint rules, two checks, the suite-ran note → journal/decisions/2026-10-29-lanes-leftovers.md
- The coordinator ends a run only when the lane count its opens used saw no lane → journal/decisions/2026-10-29-lane-count-end-check.md
- Entries that survive: the session checks its own, a long summary is cut and kept, one resume for a missing one → journal/decisions/2026-10-29-entries-survive.md
